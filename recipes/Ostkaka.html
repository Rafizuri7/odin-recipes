    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Ostkaka is a Swedish dessert traditionally served during the holidays, specifically at Christmas. But you can eat it whenever you like because this cheesecake is just that good! Getting the rennet may be difficult, but it can also be an adventure. If you're traditional, serve the Ostkaka with lingonberries. If you're not, raspberries, blueberries, and strawberries work the same. <em> You can even make a berry sauce to drip over it</em> and/or top it with whipped cream. You can also add a graham cracker crust to the bottom.</p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
   <ul>
    <li>1 gallon raw milk, divided</li>
    <li>Â¾ cup all-purpose flour</li>
    <li>1/2 rennet tablet</li>
    <li>1 tablespoon water</li>
    <li>1 teaspoon butter</li>
    <li>5 large eggs</li>
    <li>1 cup white sugar</li>
    <li>1 cup whipping cream</li>
    </ul>
    <h4>Directions</h4>
    <ol>
        <li><p>Mix 1 cup of cold milk with 3/4 cup of flour and stir to make a soft paste; set aside.</p></li>
        <li><p> Dissolve 1/2 tablet of rennet in water; set aside. </p></li>
        <li><p> Heat remaining milk to lukewarm, 98 to 102 degrees F (36 to 39 degrees C). Remove from heat. Add the soft paste mixture and stir in the dissolved rennet. Stir often until milk begins to set; cover and let stand until firm, about 1 hour.</p></li>
        <li><p> Break up the milk mixture using gentle hands, taking care to keep the curds intact. Strain most of the whey and discard or set aside for another use.</p></li>
        <li><p> Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Coat a 9x13-inch baking dish with 1 teaspoon butter.</p></li>
        <li><p> Mix together eggs, sugar, and whipping cream. Add this cream mixture to the strained curd and mix. Pour combined mixture into the prepared baking dish and softly spread it out so that the top of the dessert is flat.</p></li>
        <li><p> Bake in the preheated oven for 30 minutes. Reduce the heat to 325 degrees F (165 degrees C). Continue to cook until set and browned on top, about 30 minutes more. Let cool before serving and refrigerate when stored.</p></li>
